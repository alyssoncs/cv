\aboutme{
	I've always wanted to learn how things work under the hood, and since I got my first computer it became clear to me what I was going to do for the rest of my days. I strongly believe that creating technology is one of the most human activities there is.

\section{interests}
I've became very interested in subjects like algorithms, operating systems, system development, IoT and much more.

System development, Android development and Software Architecture are some of the subjects that I'm currently interested in and studying.

\section{other information}

Pursuing a computer science degree was the next logical step to make. I became passionate about many fields.

Eventually I came to the conclusion that mastering the basis, the fundamentals, is the way to go to be a competent professional, so I usually follow a bottom-up approach when studying any subjects.
